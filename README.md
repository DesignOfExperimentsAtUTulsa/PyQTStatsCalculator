An introduction to Python and QT for simple descriptive statistics calculations.

The program and code is written in WinPython-32bit-3.5.3.1Qt5, which can be downloaded from:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/winpython/files/WinPython_3.5/3.5.3.1/WinPython-32bit-3.5.3.1Qt5.exe/download

## Assignment 1
  1. Install WinPython-32bit-3.5.3.1Qt5. 
  2. Create a new branch as first-last-HW1 in the repository. 
  2. Starting with 01_basic_GUI_with_table.py, add the ability to calculate all the quantities from the MS Excel descriptive statistics add-in to automatically calculate and display. Demonstrate the results from this program match Excel. Use the same datasets in each program.  
  4. Change the GUI window title to include your name.
  5. Print the results from Excel on one page with your name. 
  6. Embed a screenshot of your working program in the Excel document so it will print on the same page. 
  3. Add a dialog box to open and load any Comma Separated Values table.
  7. Submit a pull request.  

## Assignment 2
  1. Add the ability to plot a normalized Histogram of the selected data in the table.
  2. Create a new branch as first-last-HW2 in the repository. 
  2. Add a menu option to open a CSV data file.
  3. Add a checkbox for at least 5 distribution functions to plot over the top of the Histogram. 
    1. Include a legend and appropriate labels on your graph.
    2. Include axes labels. (Challenge: make the labels editable in your program).
  4. Use a grid style layout for your GUI
  5. Save the plot to a PDF when you double click on it.
  6. Try to find one of the most obscure distributions as one of your 5. Please try to be different than everyone else. 
  7. Print and turn in a screenshot of your GUI on one page. Be sure your name in in the window title.
  8. Print and turn in the PDF file of the properly labeled Histogram with 2 distributions shown.
  9. Submit a pull request.
